# QuitForBit MVP - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy and test the QuitForBit MVP.

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration
Ensure Firebase is properly configured:
- `firebase_options.dart` exists
- `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) are in place
- Firebase project has Authentication and Firestore enabled

### 3. Environment Check
```bash
flutter doctor
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## 📱 Local Testing

### Web Testing (Recommended for MVP)
```bash
flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname localhost --web-port 8080
```

Access the app at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Mobile Testing (Optional)
```bash
# iOS Simulator
flutter run -d ios

# Android Emulator  
flutter run -d android
```

## 🧪 MVP Testing Workflow

### Test User Journey

1. **Open App**
   - Should show splash screen
   - Navigate to authentication

2. **Create Account**
   - Use email: `test@quitforbit.com`
   - Password: `testpass123`
   - Should navigate to onboarding

3. **Complete Onboarding**
   - Step 1: Welcome message
   - Step 2: How it works explanation
   - Step 3: Bitcoin wallet setup
   - Should receive $1 Bitcoin reward
   - Navigate to dashboard

4. **Dashboard Validation**
   - Verify streak shows "Start your journey" or "1 day clean"
   - Check Bitcoin balance shows $1.00 (or more)
   - Next milestone shows "First Day" or "One Week"
   - Check-in button available

5. **Daily Check-in**
   - Click "Daily Check-in"
   - Verify streak increments
   - Check Bitcoin reward if milestone reached
   - Button should disable after check-in

6. **Test Features**
   - Panic button opens dialog
   - Breathing exercise works
   - Profile menu accessible
   - Settings functional

## 🔧 Debugging Common Issues

### Authentication Issues
```dart
// Check Firebase Auth configuration
firebase_auth: ^4.17.8
```

### Firestore Permission Errors
Update Firestore rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /bitcoin_transactions/{transactionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /milestones/{milestoneId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Bitcoin Service Errors
Check network connectivity for price fetching:
```dart
// Bitcoin price API should be accessible
https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json
```

## 🌐 Web Deployment

### Firebase Hosting
```bash
# Build for web
flutter build web

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Alternative: Netlify
```bash
# Build for web
flutter build web

# Deploy build/web folder to Netlify
```
